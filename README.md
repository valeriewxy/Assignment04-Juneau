I plan to use same background color and website layout for the three students from the orginal website because of the hings that they have in common: male, major in (Financial) Economics, experience in computer science, involvement in fraternities. I am going to apply a different background color or layout to the "odd team member". I chose Sarach as the fourth member on the website because she is a girl and her major interest on humanities, which is completely different from the other three students. She majors Digital Media Studies and has two clusters in Korean and Psycology.

Layout Suggestions：
Each web pages could have a common footer.
Designer can decide whether or not to keep the original home page styles.
The HTML form could be positioned on a new page, and this page should use the same layout as the students' pages do. 

Typeface/Font Suggestion：
The h1s should be styled using fonts that are clear and powerful.
It might be better to use san-serif font on the website to convey simpilicity and modernity.
All the body paragraphs should use the same font.

About HTML Form：
Since we are making a portfolio website, I included the form as a "contact us" section. The web form asks input from users about their contact information including name, e-mail and the message they would like to send, with a sumbit at the end of the form.
Name - input tag, label: Name, type: text;
Email - input tag, label: E-mail, type: email;
Message - label: Message, textarea tag, rows = "5", cols = "50"
After the user clicks submit, a window will be open with text "Thank you for your message"
