						<h1>Oliver Ostriker</h1>

						<p>My name is Oliver Ostriker and I am a junior at the University of Rochester majoring in Financial Economics with minors in both Business and Computer Science. I am originally from Greenwich, Connecticut where I attended Greenwich High School. In High School, I really enjoyed an AP Economics course that I took, and therefore decided I wanted to major in something economics related. Because of this, I came across the University of Rochester which happened to have an incredible economics program. In addition, I had an uncle who lived in Rochester and a sister attending the school, so overall the U of R seemed like a great fit.</p>

						<h2>Experience</h2>

						<p>This past summer I completed an internship at Skyview Ventures LLC, a renewable energy finance, development and asset management company. At Skyview Ventures, I had the opportunity to learn about the solar market through research and analysis into government policies that affect the supply and demand of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs). This experience helped me develop research and analytical skills as well as interpersonal and communication skills necessary to present my findings to the senior staff and president of the firm. I spent my time at the office working in a fast-paced trading environment, and learned to pay great attention to detail, deliver work quickly and consistently, and obtained trust from the senior staff in my ability to deliver and solve problems on my own. As a result of this experience, I have been able to develop stronger problem-solving skills while growing my knowledge of finance and the solar market. In addition, I assisted in day-to-day activities such as reviewing trade agreements for SRECs and inputting them into the Skyview trading software, generating and sending out invoices to buyers and managing our company’s accounts payable and receivable through the use of spreadsheets and the company’s bank statements. I also attended a solar summit at John Jay College where innovations in the solar and solar storage markets were discussed and presented findings to the president and senior staff. During the summer after my freshman year, I acted as a camp counselor at Camp Gan Israel. At Camp Gan Israel, me and one other counselor lead a group of about 15 five and six year olds through various activities, including arts and crafts and sports. In high school, I acted as an SAT math tutor for Carnegie and Pollak, an SAT tutoring company. I would help teach classes on the weekends for sophomores and juniors looking to take the test within the coming year. On campus, I have experience working as a Program Assistant for the University of Rochester’s Center for Emerging and Innovative Sciences (CEIS), a program that promotes economic development in the upstate New York region. Here I had the opportunity to conduct research into the optics and photonics industries of upstate New York, and to help organize and set-up both the 2017 CEIS Technology Showcase and the 2017 Light and Sound Interactive, conferences that attracted hundreds of members of the optics and photonics industries including university researchers and executives from companies with areas of common interest. Organizing the conferences with other program assistants gave me insight into acquiring stronger leadership and teamwork skills which helped to ensure the conferences’ success. I also have had to use Microsoft Excel to compile yearly Economic Impact reports that display the total dollar value of CEIS-supported research based on partner companies' reported financials. In addition, I have learned great time management skills on campus through balancing my academics, my campus job, my position as vice president of my fraternity, Theta Chi. As vice president, I have acted as the head of the philanthropy, recruitment, and social committees within our organization. I have gained great project management and teamwork skills through helping plan, set-up, and run various different events across all three of these committees. I am particularly proud of the work that I have done for the philanthropy committee, of which I have created a spikeball tournament event that raised over $200 for the USO, and put together an event and Gofundme for the Wilmot Cancer Center that raised over $1,500 for cancer research. Because of my wide range of majors and minors, I have had the ability to participate in many different types of classes on campus.</p>

						<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

						<p>At school, I have taken Elements of Probability and Statistics, Introduction to Debate, Introduction to Economics, Freshman Writing, Reporting and Writing the News, Honors Intermediate Microeconomics, Financial Accounting, Web Design and Development, Feature Writing, Intermediate Macroeconomics, Managerial Accounting, Financial Management, Economic Theory of Organizations, Introduction to Anthropology, Introduction to Python, Creative Computing, Business Law, Introduction to Psychology, and Economics of Sports. I am also working as a Teaching Assistant this semester for Economics of Sports. Outside of school, I am a huge sports fan, and particularly have an interest in basketball. I love playing pick-up and intramural basketball whenever I have free time, and I am a huge fan of the Boston Celtics. I became a Celtics fan in 2003, when my favorite player in Backyard Basketball was Paul Pierce (the Celtics star small forward). From there, I asked for a Paul Pierce jersey for my 7th birthday and wore it to school almost every day in 1st grade. From there, the rest has been history. .I am also a big fan of college basketball, and enjoy rooting for both the University of Connecticut and Syracuse. Uconn because I am from Connecticut and attended the basketball camp at Uconn for many years, and Syracuse because the school is my mom’s alma mater. I am also on the Club Volleyball team, I am a member of Meliora Capital Management (a student investment fund on campus), and a member of the University of Rochester Investment Banking Club. I also love to ski, play fantasy sports (mostly football and basketball), and travel (whether with family or with friends). Unfortunately, I tore my ACL this past summer and have not been able to participate in any athletic endeavors as a result, though I have just recently finished my physical therapy and will start playing basketball again very soon.</p>
